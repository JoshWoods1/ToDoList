# Overview

This is a beginner mobile app idea that I had to introduce myself to kotlin. It is a simple ToDo app and you are able to add and delete items from the list.

I figured that it would be a good, simple app to help me to learn the basics of kotlin and to begin on mobile development.

# Development Environment

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose

I used the kotlin language and jetpack compose that works in line with kotlin to help make a better user interface. There was a lot that I did not know going into this project and even after learning the basics I still don't feel competent in these areas.

# Future Work

- I plan on making sure that all of the logic that I have implemented is used in the app and allows it to be functional.
- I will continue to make the app look user friendly and more visually appealing.
